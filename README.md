### Approach

------------

- To maximize the scanning score we calculated the throughput for each library using the below formula.

- ![Equation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Saurabh-Singh-00/hash-code-2020/master/images/equation.png "Equation")

- The Libraries are then sorted in *O(logN)* based on their throughput so that the library with maximum throughput can be selected first.

- If the Signup period of the selected library is less than the TOTAL_DAYS remaining then the libraries can be signed up and dispatched for scanning.

- Maximum score can be attained if all the books are scanned within the time frame atleast once as illustrated below.
